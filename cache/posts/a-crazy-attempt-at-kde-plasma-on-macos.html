<p>So I started an adventure to see what it would take and if even possible to get some kind of linux desktop environment
running successfully. Let is be known while this was fun, was definitely not working nor practical.</p>
<p>The first step was to download and get docker setup on my mac. This all started because I heard about a simple program
called kitematic in regards to docker. Kirematic allows a simple GUI wrapper around docker hub and docker in general.
You can download this great tool via <a class="reference external" href="https://kitematic.com/">https://kitematic.com/</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have that installed, I downloaded the kdeneon sponsored all image. This quickly led to the downhill snowball
that would eventually takeover this side project. I found out real quick that it was having a hard time findout the
<tt class="docutils literal">DISPLAY</tt> variable</p>
<img alt="/galleries/display.png" src="/galleries/display.png" />
<p>This was resolved via installing xquartz for macOS. You can get this via <a class="reference external" href="https://www.xquartz.org/">https://www.xquartz.org/</a>. The second step was
to run the command <tt class="docutils literal">socat <span class="pre">TCP-LISTEN:6000,reuseaddr,fork</span> <span class="pre">UNIX-CLIENT:\&quot;$DISPLAY\&quot;</span></tt> in a separate terminal. Once you
have this running in a terminal, you need to set the <tt class="docutils literal">DISPLAY</tt> variable to following in Kitematic: <tt class="docutils literal">ipaddress:0</tt>
(replacing ipaddress with you address). At this point the docker image should start for you, and this is where the
layers of crazy start coming out.</p>
<p>You will notice that once you fix the <tt class="docutils literal">DISPLAY</tt> variable issue, you now run into openGL issues. You need to edit the
file <tt class="docutils literal">/opt/X11/bin/startx</tt> and look for the options <tt class="docutils literal">defaultserverargs</tt>. Add <tt class="docutils literal">+iglx</tt> to those options using you
favorite editor and save. Log out and back in to restart xquartz and give it another try.</p>
<p>At this point, you start seeing some real craziness, red screens and all.</p>
<img alt="/galleries/red.png" src="/galleries/red.png" />
<p>This is where I got stuck. Apparently xqaurtz is stuck to openGL 2.1 where KDE and more modern X11 programs expect you
to be able to produce openGL 3+.</p>
<p>At this point, I wouldn't say I have given up, but defiitely was a fun experiement and provided great insight. We shall
see where this leads me.</p>
